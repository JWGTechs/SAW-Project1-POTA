# Project One: Real-Time Monitoring and Messaging

## Due by Thursday, October 1, 2020

## Project Description

For this project, you and a small team will leverage some combination of ExpressJS, Web Sockets/socket.io, Web Workers, Service Workers, and the Notifications API to create a web-based system that monitors a source for changes in data.

For example, you might periodically scrape the contents of the daily Congressional Record at congress.gov and run a diff against your last retrieved copy. Your project would then perhaps provide notifications of changes, as well as a page highlighting the changes as they’ve occurred–and that would also update in real-time as changes come in.

You can do this with any source of data that updates multiple times over the course of a typical day. Just be sure you do not run afoul of the copyright laws surrounding the data you’re using. (US Government publications, for example, generally are not protected by copyright because they are in the public domain.

## Project Goals

    Learn to programmatically access web-available resources, and run comparisons on the results

    Learn to command established real-time communication APIs, including Web Workers, Web Sockets, and Web Notifications

    Improve your ability to work with a centralized group repository and an individual fork

    ITMD 545 Only: Learn to serialize data in a web-friendly format like XML or JSON
